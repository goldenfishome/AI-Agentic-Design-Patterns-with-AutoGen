      "### Step 2: Calculate Comparison Metrics\n",

      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Gather News or Relevant Market Events\n",

      "from newsapi import NewsApiClient\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Create Visual Representation\n",
      "Plot graphs using `matplotlib` or similar libraries to visually present the stock's performance.\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
      "\n",
      "plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\n",
      "plt.plot(nvda_data.index, nvda_data['Adj Close'], marker='o', linestyle='-')\n",

      "plt.grid(True)\n",

      "### Step 3: Gather News or Relevant Market Events\n",

      "### Step 4: Create Visual Representation\n",
      "Plot graphs using `matplotlib` or similar libraries to visually present the stock's performance.\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
      "\n",
